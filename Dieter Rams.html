                                                Dieter Rams.....



Dieter Rams approach on appearance and his overall view on design is a good sum of how each “property” can further a product function, look, and perspective. The ideal with a good design is considered “Long Lasting“  is the pinnacle of how every designer should think when it comes to brain storming concepts and ideals that exceed expectations and other products within the same market. Simple design is good design to the fact it can never be compromise due how  original or basic a single thing can be. The sixth commandant  was that  “Good design is honest….” , how something so self-explanatory or so simple, that it can show the make, colors, or function of the product very vividly clear. I do believe that every product should either have a short story or long introduction to how it will change your life or living. Then. The fifth commandant being that good design is not a representation of art or must be completely useful down to every screw. 
How nothing outside the realm of design should further change your perception on the product intentions.
